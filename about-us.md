Hi! My name is Reece and I created How To Play Sport with my team to provide a useful resource for guides to our favourite sports.

Choosing the right equipment you need to play is a daunting experience, especially for new players. No one wants to feel conned, or like they are making a huge mistake and wasting their money. This is what I aim to help with. Helpful, fluff-free reviews that explains the key pain-points and features in a simple to understand and friendly manner.

With years of experience under my belt I hope I can help you select the right equipment, and who knows, maybe improve your game along the way!
