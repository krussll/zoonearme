### 1) ZooMontana

Situated in the beautiful city of Billings, ZooMontana is a haven for wildlife and a thrilling attraction for family outings. 

The zoo, covering an expansive 70 acres, is home to an impressive variety of over 100 animals including crowd favorites like tigers, sloths, and bears. 

Coupled with a medium size that can be easily navigated in 2-3 hours, families have the chance to appreciate myriad species and learn about them without overwhelming little explorers or overtiring older ones. 

The zoo's size is just right—large enough to invite a sense of grandeur and excitement, but small enough to maintain a warm, intimate environment perfect for family bonding.

Another merit of this captivating zoo is its affordable pricing—a full round of exploration around ZooMontana for a typical family of four costs a total of $44. 

This includes the price for adults tickets priced at $12 each, child's tickets at $9, and discounted concession tickets at $10. 

Moreover, children under the age of two get to enjoy ZooMontana’s thrills absolutely free. 

The zoo also goes beyond being just a display of animals - it plays a key role in conservation and education, with accessible pathways that make it easy for everyone to engage in learning, regardless if they are in wheelchairs or pushing strollers. 

And for families who want to take a break and fuel up between viewing exhibits, ZooMontana allows you to bring your own food and drinks, plus they have food stalls throughout. 

So, pack a picnic, load up the family, and enjoy Montana's beloved zoo.

### 2) Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center

Situated at the western gates of Yellowstone National Park, the Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center is an exceptional zoo experience unique to Montana. 

Covering an impressive 14 acres, this facility offers an educational and intimate look at some of Montana’s most awe-inspiring native species such as grizzly bears, wolves, otters, and birds of prey. 

Serving as a sanctuary for these rescued animals, the Center plays a critical role in wildlife education and conservation, making it not only a fun family destination but also a place where visitors can participate in the critical conservation of these incredible creatures.

What makes Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center one of the best zoos in Montana for families, especially those with older children, is its accessibility and affordability. 

It boasts wheelchair-friendly walkways, and can be comprehensively covered in just 1.5 hours, making it ideal for families on a tight schedule. 

Moreover, at a total cost of $56 for a family of four and free entry for children under four, it provides an educational and engaging outing without breaking the bank. 

Although there are no food stalls on-site, families are warmly encouraged to bring their own food and drinks to enjoy while exploring the complex, adding to the leisurely and relaxed atmosphere. 

While there are no animal encounters or permissions for pets, service animals are welcome, adding to the site's inclusivity. 

With plentiful free parking, families have the convenience to come and leave as they please. 

However, the location is tucked away, making it inaccessible by public transport, thus, contact the zoo for the best directions to visit this hidden Montana gem.
