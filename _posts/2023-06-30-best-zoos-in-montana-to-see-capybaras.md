## At A Glance 

Despite Montana being home to an abundance of wildlife and several zoological parks, one may be surprised to learn that the state’s zoos currently do not house any Capybaras. 

Capybaras, the largest living rodents on Earth, are natives of South America and are accustomed to living in environments that largely consist of wetland and savannah. 

The zoos in Montana, such as Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center and Zoo Montana, are well-known for an interesting array of creatures, but the presence of Capybaras is noticeably missing.

Why might this be the case? It all comes down to climate compatibility. 

Montana's climate is characterized by cold winters and mild summers, a stark contrast from the Capybaras' natural habitat, where the temperatures are generally warm and humid. 

Capybaras, being semi-aquatic, also need to have constant access to water in order to keep their dry skin moisturized. 

The availability of such an environment in Montana is challenging due to the state's geographical and climatic conditions. 

Therefore, it’s not feasible to sustain a Capybara-friendly environment within Montana’s zoos.

## Other Zoos To Enjoy Without Capybaras

There are so many other great zoos to enjoy in Montana. 

If you want to try another zoo that doesn't have Capybaras, then one of these might be right for you.

### ZooMontana

Nestled in the city of Billings, and spread across an expansive 70 acres, ZooMontana is one of the perfect destinations in the state for capybara enthusiasts. 

Recognized primarily for its medium size, it is ideal for family excursions that have a mix of older children, toddlers, and members requiring disability access. 

While its sprawling walkways promise accessibility to everyone who visits, it's the accessibility to capybaras and other notable animals like tigers, sloths, and bears, that makes it truly stand out. 

With over 100 animals accommodated within its premises like a grand menagerie, it is a treasure trove for nature lovers and a specially delightful experience for those seeking a closer look at these semi-aquatic mammals.

Visiting ZooMontana is less of a task and more of an experience that takes roughly two to three hours to fully delve into, allowing an intimate witness to the wonder of capybaras and other residents of the animal kingdom. 

While adult entry fee is priced at $12 and children are admitted for $9, it's remarkable that the zoo offers free entry to infants under two and has concessionary tickets priced at a reasonable $10. 

The total spends for a family of four comes around $44, making it a cost-effective outing for families. 

The zoo not only provides free parking but also adds a personal touch by allowing visitors to bring their own food and drink, enhancing the homely feel of your day-long trip. 

While pets are a no-go area, service animals are welcome, adding a considerate dimension to their policies and confirming their dedication to conservation and education.
