The STL Zoo is remarkable for its free entry, whether you're an adult, a child or a concession holder. 

There is no set age for children's free entry as everyone can enjoy the zoo's features free of charge. 

Consequently, an average family of 4's general admission cost would be nonexistent, although car parking costs $15. 

On the contrary, Endangered Wolf Center involves expenses for attendees. 

An adult ticket is priced at $18, while children's tickets bear a cost of $15 each. 

Concessions tickets are also available for $18.

## Popular Animals 

When comparing the variety of animals at STL Zoo and the Endangered Wolf Center, there is a striking difference. 

STL Zoo, located in St Louis, offers an extensive range of animals including tigers, giraffes, capybaras, elephants, sloths, bears, lions, and sea lions.

## Accesibility 

Both the STL Zoo and the Endangered Wolf Center have made efforts to ensure accessibility for all their guests, including those with mobility difficulties. 

The STL Zoo in St. 

Louis has designed its zoo keeping the comfort and accessibility of visitors in mind, with walkways suitable for wheelchair use. 

Even so, with the size and terrain variations of the 90-acre zoo, visitors may need to plan accordingly for the 2 to 3 hours on average it would take to explore all the attractions. 

On the other hand, the Endangered Wolf Center in Eureka does provide disability access, but it's important to note that their trails could be difficult for some as they may not be suitable for wheelchairs. 

At 2000 acres, its size and forestry terrain could also pose potential challenges for those who have difficulty walking. 

It would be ideal for prospective visitors to contact the respective zoos for additional information on their disability access to better assess and plan their visit.

## Pefect For

The STL Zoo is a perfect choice for families with children of all ages. 

It is apt for toddlers, older children and it provides suitable walkways for participants with disabilities. 

Given its wide array of animal exhibits including tigers, giraffes, capybaras, elephants, sloths and more, coupled with free entry, it provides an entertaining and educational day out without breaking the bank. 

The Endangered Wolf Center, on the other hand, is better suited for families with older children. 

The terrain may pose a challenge for wheelchairs and its focus on wolf rescue and conservation may appeal to children with a specific interest in wolves and foxes. 

While it is a ticketed facility, remember that parking here is free and visitors are welcome to bring their own food and drink. 

Overall, both Zoos offer unique experiences but if budget-friendly, variety of exhibits and toddler-friendliness is a priority, STL Zoo wins out. 

If education centered around specialised species in a vast natural habitat is what you're after, then the Endangered Wolf Center is the place to be.
