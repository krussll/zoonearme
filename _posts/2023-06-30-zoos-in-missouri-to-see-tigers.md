## Other Zoos To Enjoy Without Tigers

There are so many other great zoos to enjoy in Missouri. 

If you want to try another zoo that doesn't have Tigers, then one of these might be right for you.

### Endangered Wolf Center

Nestled in the heart of Eureka, Missouri is the remarkable Endangered Wolf Center - a playground for nature lovers and offering an invaluable opportunity to witness wildlife within an expansive 2000-acre sanctuary. 

Dedicated to the preservation and conservation of wolves and foxes, it may seem an unlikely place to mention in an article about seeing tigers. 

However, this center represents a far more profound aspect of any tiger viewing experience. 

While it doesn’t house tigers, the significance of rare species conservation and wildlife education that can be observed and learned at this zoo somehow creates an awareness among visitors that not only enchants but also enhances their future experiences of seeing tigers.

The Endangered Wolf Center proves to be a great destination for families with older children, offering a comprehensive 90-minute tour that covers the astounding range of wolves and foxes. 

It's worth noting that it not only focuses on animal display but also actively participates in their protection and propagation in a safe and secure environment. 

Albeit with a note of caution for wheelchair users that trails may be unsuitable for them, overall the zoo leaves no stone unturned in making all potential visitors feel welcome. 

While one cannot hold the animals or bring pets (with the exception of service animals), children under the age of 3 have free entry, making it an affordable educational trip for families. 

Be ready to pack your own lunch, as there are no food stalls in the zoo but rest assured for free parking as you spend the day in the company of these magnificent creatures. 

A visit to the Endangered Wolf Center therefore, encapsulates an enriching wildlife experience that readies a visitor for their keenly anticipated encounter with the majestic Tigers in other Missouri zoos.
