## Other Zoos To Enjoy Without Tigers

There are so many other great zoos to enjoy in Montana. 

If you want to try another zoo that doesn't have Tigers, then one of these might be right for you.

### Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center

The Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center located in the picturesque setting of West Yellowstone, Montana, is an absolute must-visit for any wildlife enthusiast. 

Even though it does not have Tigers in its list, the center stands out for providing the unique opportunity to witness wolves and grizzly bears, both rescued and conserved in large, accommodating habitats. 

The zoo is sprawling across 14 acres of land, offering ample space for its well-cared stars - the grizzly bears, wolves, otters, and birds of prey to thrive. 

These highlights, well-preserved and easy to explore in about an hour and a half, make it one of the best zoos in the state, even without the presence of Tigers.

Affordability and Accessibility are also high on Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center's list of attributes. 

The center is conducive for both families with older children and individuals with disabilities, with wheelchair-friendly walkways ensuring all guests can enjoy the full beauty of the zoo. 

With the entry ticket pricing set very reasonably at $16.5 for an adult, $11.5 for a child and concessions at $15.5, a family of four can experience all offerings within a modest budget of $56. 

Moreover, children under four are admitted free, emphasizing the center's family-friendly stance. 

While there are no food stalls on-site, visitors have the option of bringing their own food and drinks - a rarity among zoos! Parking does not add to the cost of your visit as it is available for free. 

Service animals are welcome too, adding to the list of conveniences that sets the Grizzly bear & Wolf Discovery Center apart in Montana, regardless of its lack of Tigers.
