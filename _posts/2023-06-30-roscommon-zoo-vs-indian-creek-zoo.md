## Accesibility 

When considering accessibility for visitors who use wheelchairs or have difficulty walking, both Roscommon Zoo and Indian Creek Zoo strive to be inclusive. 

However, the level of accessibility they manage to provide is quite different. 

At Roscommon Zoo, the paths are constructed of grass and gravel, which can make navigation somewhat challenging for those in wheelchairs. 

Nevertheless, the zoo does provide access for those with disabilities. 

Conversely, Indian Creek Zoo has implemented a dedicated wheelchair route, which should provide more comfortable and user-friendly navigation for visitors with mobility limitations. 

This provision represents a more comprehensive and thoughtful approach to ensuring accessibility for all visitors. 

Hence, while both zoos value inclusivity, Indian Creek Zoo appears to offer superior wheelchair accessibility.

The Roscommon Zoo, a small and independent zoo, is wonderful for an afternoon outing, particularly for families with toddlers. 

As an affordable trip, it offers easy to navigate terrain, but it's important to note that the grass and gravel paths may not be ideal for wheelchair users. 

In contrast, Indian Creek Zoo, specifically designed for family trips and field experiences, is a more extensive trip with a two-hour average visit time and a dedicated wheelchair route, making it accessible for a wider range of visitors.
