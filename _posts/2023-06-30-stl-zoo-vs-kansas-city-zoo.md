## At A Glance 

Both the STL Zoo and the Kansas City Zoo offer unique, educational experiences for families and animal enthusiasts alike in the heart of Missouri. 

The STL Zoo, situated on a 90-acre land in St. 

Louis, prides itself on its free entry and various animal experiences featuring tigers, giraffes, capybaras, elephants, sloths, and a host of others. 

With 16,000 animals, it promotes an enriching and fun-filled outing for the whole family, particularly favoring those needing disability access. 

However, park at your own expense of $15. 


On the other hand, the Kansas City Zoo, situated on a vast 202-acre land, charges an entry fee with adults paying $22 while children and consessions tickets are $20 each. 

It hosts an array of animals including penguins, in addition to those the STL zoo houses, and provides disability access as well. 

Parking is offered for free, which may offset the cost of entry for some visitors. 

While both zoos discourage holding animals and bringing pet dogs (unless service animals), they both allow you to pack your own food and drink for an enjoyable, custom picnic experience amidst nature.

Meanwhile, Kansas City Zoo offers a more extensive layout for guests to traverse.
