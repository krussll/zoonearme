## At A Glance 

While planning a trip to Minnesota with hopes of seeing capybaras in their numerous zoos, it's important to take note of a surprising reality. 

I regret to inform you that there are no zoos in the entire state of Minnesota that boast of harboring Capybaras. 

Yes, you read that right. 

Despite its rich biodiversity and numerous quality zoos, you are unlikely to come across this large rodent species native to South America while touring Minnesota.

The underlying reason for the absence of these fascinating creatures in Minnesota's zoos is most likely the state's climate. 

Capybaras are semi-aquatic animals who thrive in hot and humid environments typical of their homeland in South America, especially near bodies of water. 

Minnesota's climate, characterized by cold, harsh winters and moderate to mild summers, unfortunately, isn't a conducive environment for them. 

Besides, Capybaras require constant access to water not just for hydration, but to keep their dry skin moist and to escape from predators in the wild. 

In a nutshell, the environment required to sustain Capybaras in good health is quite challenging to recreate in the North Star State.
