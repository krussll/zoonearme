## At A Glance

While Michigan boasts an array of exceptional wildlife parks and zoos, it's important to shed light on a point of common misconception - the suitability of these establishments for our canine friends. 

Unfortunately, for hygiene, safety and the well-being of the animals in their care, zoos across Michigan, like most around the world, do not permit dogs on their premises. 

This policy is put in place to prevent potential transmission of diseases, unnecessary stress for both the zoo animals and visiting dogs, and to avoid any possible conflicts or unpredictable incidents. 

So, while we love our furry four-legged family members, it's best to leave them comfortably at home when planning a zoo outing, and perhaps consider a fun-packed trip to a dog-friendly park instead.
