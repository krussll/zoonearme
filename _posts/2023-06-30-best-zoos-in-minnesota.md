Nestled in picturesque Apple Valley, Minnesota, the Minnesota Zoo is a must-see large zoo for any family outings or day trips. 

Covering a massive 485 acres, this famed zoo is home to a remarkable 4,500 animals that represent 505 different species, a few of which include exotic tigers, inquisitive bears, and lively penguins. 

The zoo has notably positioned itself as a leader in conservation and emanates attentiveness to its mission throughout the zoo. 

Even though it is an expansive zoo, an average visit would still likely only take up 3-4 hours, making it achievable and enjoyable in a single day. 

 The cost of the visit is also reasonable; at only $19.95 for adults, $13.95 for children and concessions and free for children under two, a family of four could have an amazing day out for an average of just $67.8.

Despite it being slightly inaccessible by public transport, the Minnesota Zoo offers ample parking for a minor cost of $7.00 per car. 

When it comes to dining options, the zoo extends a broad array of food stalls catering to many dietary preferences; you can even bring your own food and drinks! Do note that while enjoying the expansive range of fauna, the chances to hold any of them are limited due to safety measures. 

It's also critical to note that while your beloved pet dogs can't accompany you on this adventure, service animals are rightfully welcomed. 

In case of any queries, the zoo's administration can be easily reached for further clarifications. 

With so much to offer, the Minnesota Zoo ensures an engaging, family-friendly experience for everyone but is particularly appropriate for families with older children.
