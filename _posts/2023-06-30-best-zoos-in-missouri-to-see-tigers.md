The Endangered Wolf Center in Eureka, Missouri, is certainly an exclusive gem of a zoo to visit due to its unique focus on the preservation of wolves and foxes. 

Although it may not house a variety of common zoo animals like elephants or monkeys, animal enthusiasts will be intrigued by the opportunity to observe these often misunderstood creatures in a functional and safe habitat. 

Situated on a massive 2000-acre property, the Center provides a spacious and natural environment for these animals, steering clear from the cage-like or cramped spaces one might encounter in typical zoos. 

Browsing through this large zoo takes about 90 minutes on average, leaving just the perfect amount of time to deeply explore and appreciate each exhibit without feeling rushed.

As one of the best zoos in Missouri, the Endangered Wolf Center is certainly a must-see, even without the presence of tigers. 

The entrance fee, considering the exceptional experience on offer, is reasonably priced at $18 for an adult and $15 for a child, with concessions offered at the same price as an adult ticket. 

If you’re planning a family visit, an average family of four will spend around $66, and the youngest family members under three years old can enjoy the experience free of charge. 

Although the zoo lacks accessibility through public transport, it makes up for it with ample free parking, perfect for families planning a day trip. 

Unfortunately, there are no food stalls within the property, but visitors are welcome to bring their own snacks and drinks, making it a perfect location for a family picnic surrounded by the beauty of nature. 



Note: Although the zoo may less accessible for wheelchairs due to the nature of the trails, the Endangered Wolf Center cherishes inclusivity; we recommend you to check with the Center directly to gather information about any potential facility arrangements they may have for visitors with special needs.

Located in the bustling city of St. 

Louis, Grant's Farm stands as an expanse of 280 acres offering an unparalleled experience for those enthralled by the majesty and beauty of wildlife. 

Unlike many zoos which ask for a hefty admission fee, Grant's Farm offers an inclusive experience, opening its doors free of charge. 

An animal sanctuary that not only provides you with the chance of seeing a variety of animals, including deer and goats, but also a priceless opportunity of spending quality time exploring the land at your own pace. 

This is a remarkable place to visit in the state of Missouri, even if Tigers are not among its inhabitants, thanks to a meticulously planned walking space that's specifically designed to maximize the satisfaction of families with toddlers, older children, and individuals with disabilities.

When viewing this place as one of the best zoos in Missouri, one must consider various factors outside of simply housing Tigers. 

First and foremost, affordability is key. 

With no admission charge, the only cost you'd incur would be for parking, standing at $16 per car. 

Few places offer the opportunity for a whole family to step into an expansive wildlife sanctuary without having a dent in bottom-line. 

Second, the overall experience that the zoo offers to its guests, especially to large families, is tremendous. 

They can spend an entire day, approximately 2-3 hours, embarking on a wonderful adventure exploring every nook and corner of the zoo. 

Thanks to the zoo's stern policy of not allowing pets and maintaining a robust restriction on holding animals, it ensures the safety of its inhabitants and an undisturbed enjoyable environment for its guests. 

The presence of food stalls throughout the zoo keeps those hunger pangs at bay, although it's worth noting that bringing your own food and drink is not permitted. 

The absence of public transport connectivity does add a bit of inconvenience but the joy and memories you'd treasure from visiting Grant's Farm will certainly make up for it. 

So, while it may not be the go-to for Tigers, it definitely is a haven that encourages appreciation for wildlife and offers a great bonding experience for families or individuals, irrespective of their age or abilities.
