## At A Glance

While Minnesota boasts some uniquely wonderful zoos, packed with a vast array of wildlife from around the globe, it's important to highlight that these establishments are not suitable for dogs. 

Zoos are designed and maintained with the welfare of their inhabitants at heart, encompassing a diverse collection of animals, some of which are not comfortable around canines. 

Moreover, the sights, sounds, and smells of the zoo environment can be incredibly stressful for dogs. 

Therefore, in the interest of maintaining a safe, serene, and stress-free environment for zoo residents– as well as for the comfort of your furry friend– it is generally forbidden to bring dogs or other pets to these locations.
