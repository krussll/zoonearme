## At A Glance 

It may come as a surprise, but contrary to popular belief, there are actually no zoos within the borders of Minnesota that house Capybaras. 

The lovable and often internet-famed large rodent, native to South America, is notably absent from Minnesota's renowned zoological offerings, which include the Minnesota Zoo and Como Park Zoo & Conservatory. 

Despite these facilities' diverse and comprehensive collection of species from across the globe, visitors on the hunt for Capybaras will find themselves disappointed.

The primary reason for this absence lies most likely in Minnesota's distinctive climate. 

Capybaras, being semi-aquatic animals, thrive best in warmer, humid climates that mirror their original South American habitats which are brimming with dense marshes and wetlands. 

Minnesota, famed for its bitterly cold winters and more temperate summer conditions, is starkly different from a Capybara's natural environment. 

As such, the welfare and survival of these captivating mammals might be compromised if they were to be contained within a Minnesotan zoo.
