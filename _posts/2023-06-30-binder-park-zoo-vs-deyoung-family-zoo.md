When it comes to accessibility, both Binder Park Zoo and DeYoung Family Zoo put considerable effort into providing an enjoyable experience for all visitors, including those in wheelchairs or those who have difficulty walking. 

Binder Park Zoo is noted for its disability access, explicitly stating that they provide rentable equipment to assist in mobility. 

This clearly highlights their commitment to making all their exhibits accessible for every visitor. 

On the other hand, DeYoung Family Zoo is described as wheelchair accessible, an indication of their consideration for disabled visitors. 

However, they do caveat this with a mention of certain 'tricky paths.' This might present a challenge for those less confident in navigating uneven surfaces, but it does, nevertheless, demonstrate their intent to provide a welcoming environment for all.

## Pefect For 

Both Binder Park Zoo and DeYoung Family Zoo cater well to families with older children but are not particularly toddler-friendly. 

Binder Park Zoo offers disability access with rentable equipment which makes it an excellent choice for families with particular accessibility needs. 

Its expansive 433 acres provide a full day out, aimed at inspiring and connecting visitors with nature. 

With that in mind, it's important to note that the size and terrain could also be physically demanding for senior visitors. 

DeYoung Family Zoo, on the other hand, is also wheelchair accessible but with some tricky paths. 

This smaller zoo with its 79 acres, described as large and spacious, offers a shorter, less draining day out and could therefore potentially better accommodate families with mixed age groups or those that prefer a more relaxed, casual visit. 

Both zoos offer the same restrictions such as no holding of animals, no pet dogs allowed with the exception of service animals. 

So, decisions on which zoo would be "best" will ultimately depend on the specific needs and preferences of the visitors.
