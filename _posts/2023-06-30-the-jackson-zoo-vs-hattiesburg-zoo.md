This smaller zoo is particularly renowned for their giraffe feeding experience, offering visitors a rare and personal interaction with these majestic creatures. 

One notable lack in the Hattiesburg Zoo is the absence of big cats and water mammals, both of which can be readily found at the more expansive Jackson Zoo.
