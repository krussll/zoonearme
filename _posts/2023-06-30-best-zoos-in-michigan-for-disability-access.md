Located in Royal Oak, Michigan, the Detroit Zoo is not only a conservatory that houses 245 species of animals including tigers, giraffes, bears, penguins, lions, kangaroos, camels and zebras, but it's also a renowned example of a zoo that prioritizes disability access. 

Spanning 125 acres and offering between 2-3 hours of engaging exploration, the zoo has gone to lengths to offer an inclusive experience to visitors of all abilities. 

As part of their inclusive efforts, the lay of the land includes a combination of paved, gravel, and woodchipped surfaces to cater for mobility devices, and just enough sloping topography to make it interesting without being too challenging. 

Although the zoo doesn't support public transportation access, they have ample parking facilities, and service animals are allowed to accompany their handlers, making it an ideal destination for individuals with disabilities.

Being an inclusive space, Detroit Zoo goes beyond just physical access. 

The zoo is a microcosm of education and conservation efforts, and the animals are presented in a manner that stimulates curiosity and encourages learning, attributes that are appealing to families, especially those with older children. 

Moreover, while the zoo does offer concessions, visitors also have the option to bring their own food and drink for a more personalized experience. 

There are no opportunities to hold animals, which ensures safety for all guests and reduces potential stress for the animals. 

Despite some natural terrain like hilly and sloped areas, Detroit Zoo's commitment to disability access truly sets it apart, marking it as one of the best zoos in Michigan for guests with special needs.
