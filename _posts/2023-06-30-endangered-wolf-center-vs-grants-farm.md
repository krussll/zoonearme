## At A Glance 

The Endangered Wolf Center in Eureka, Missouri and Grant's Farm in St. 

Louis, Missouri are two very distinct zoos. 

The Endangered Wolf Center is a sprawling 2000-acre zoo dedicated to rescuing and conserving wolves and foxes. 

With on average 90-minute tours and an admission ticket costing $18 for adults and $15 for children, it is suitable for families with older children due to the nature of its attractions. 

The center provides disability access with some reservations as the trails may be unsuitable for wheelchairs and there is no public transportation available. 

Visitors can bring their food and drinks, as there are no food stalls within the zoo premises.

On the other hand, Grant's Farm, albeit smaller in size (280 acres) offers a more diverse array of attractions including deer and goats, and is universally accessible for free, making it an economical choice for large families, including toddlers. 

The walkways at Grant's Farm are suitable for wheelchairs. 

However, like the Endangered Wolf Center, it cannot be accessed by public transport. 

It's important to note that unlike the Endangered Wolf Center, Grant's Farm discourages visitors from bringing food and drinks, as food stalls are readily available.

## Accesibility 

When it comes to accessibility, both Endangered Wolf Center and Grant's Farm have made notable efforts to be inclusive for all visitors, though there are differences to consider. 

For those using wheelchairs or with difficulty walking, the Endangered Wolf Center might prove to be more challenging due to the nature of its trails which may be unsuitable for wheelchairs. 

This makes navigation around the 2000-acre property potentially difficult for disabled visitors. 

Contrastingly, Grant's Farm appears to be more wheelchair-friendly with walkways that are suitable for wheelchairs. 

As such, navigating the 280-acre zoo should be less of a hassle. 

Both facilities, however, do accommodate and accept service animals, which can be an added benefit for those who rely on them. 

It's always best to contact the zoos directly for more detailed information on their disability access capabilities.

## Pefect For 

When deciding between a visit to the Endangered Wolf Center or Grant's Farm, the type of trip you're aiming for certainly matters. 

Both venues offer disability access, but depending on the mobility level, consider the fact that while Grant's Farm has wheelchair-friendly walkways, the Endangered Wolf Center’s trails might not be as accommodating for wheelchairs. 

Both places are excellent for families with older children who have an interest in wildlife and conservation. 

However, if you have toddlers in tow, Grant's Farm may be the better choice, as it is specifically mentioned as being toddler-friendly, providing an appealing option for families with children of all ages. 

Given that the admission to Grant's Farm is free, families looking for a budget-friendly day out may also find it more appealing. 

It is worth noting though that parking isn't free at Grant's Farm whereas it is at the Endangered Wolf Center.

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, both the Endangered Wolf Center and Grant's Farm offer unique experiences for those who wish to explore the wild side of Missouri. 

The Endangered Wolf Center's expansive landscape that spans across 2000 acres is particularly amazing, putting their main focus on the conservation of wolves. 

Despite not having food stalls, visitors have the liberty to bring their own food. 

Conversely, Grant's Farm, though smaller in size, offers a free but robust and highly interactive experience with the denizens of the wild. 

Their focus is on a variety of animals and providing accessible facilities for all, including toddlers. 

The availability of food stalls adds to the convenience despite being unable to bring their own food. 

However, both necessitate private transport due to their lack of public accessibility. 

Ultimately, the choice between the two will rest on your preference for animal encounters and what type of accessibility and amenities you require for your visit.
