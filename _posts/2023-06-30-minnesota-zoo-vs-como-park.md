## Accesibility 

When it comes to physical accessibility, both the Minnesota Zoo in Apple Valley and Como Park in St. 

Paul advocate for inclusivity, albeit demonstrating varying degrees of amenability for those wheelchair bound or experiencing difficulty walking. 

The Minnesota Zoo, while potentially challenging due to park geography and the nature of some trails, makes a conscientious effort to provide disability access. 

It advises visitors that certain trails may be unsuitable for wheelchairs, thereby enabling them to plan their visits efficiently. 

In contrast, Como Park has ensured that all walkways are suitable for wheelchairs. 

This layout not only makes the park universally navigable but also empowers all visitors to fully experience the vast array of animal exhibits and activities. 

In summary, both establishments make essential provisions for accessibility, yet Como Park's entirely wheelchair friendly approach may prove more accessible for visitors with mobility issues.
