The sprawling 485-acre Minnesota Zoo is home to an awe-inspiring 4,500 animals from 505 different species. 

Among the favorites of many visitors are the ubiquitous tigers, playful penguins, and lumbering bears.

The zoo offers guests a chance to marvel at a range of species that include giraffes, penguins, tigers, and rare sloths. 

Notably, the zoo is home to majestic lions, a species not mentioned within the Minnesota Zoo's highlights. 

Despite the difference in size and available species, both zoos provide unique encounters with wildlife that you would not ordinarily see in Minnesota.

## Accesibility 

When it comes to accessibility for wheelchair users or those with walking difficulties, both the Minnesota Zoo and Como Park have made efforts to cater to these visitors. 

The Minnesota Zoo, located in Apple Valley, offers accessibility, but warns that certain trails might be unsuitable for wheelchairs. 

This could potentially limit the experience for disabled visitors by excluding them from witnessing some animal habitats. 

On the other hand, Como Park, located in St Paul, extends a far warmer welcome to such guests. 

Walkways at Como Park are declared to be suitable for wheelchairs, magnifying its appeal for visitors with mobility constraints. 

Therefore, while both zoos display consideration towards accessibility, Como Park may offer a more extensive and unrestricted experience for those facing mobility challenges.

## Pefect For 

Both Minnesota Zoo and Como Park are excellent choices for a family outing, but each comes with its unique attributes that make it suitable for different kinds of visits. 

Minnesota Zoo, with its expansive terrain covering 485 acres, offers a more adventuresome environment, making it ideal for families with older children who can appreciate and engage with the day-long activities, including llama treks and dolphin shows. 

These features, coupled with limited accessibility for public transport and wheelchair-unfriendly trails, suggest a more fitting trip for those prepared for a longer, active visit. 

On the other hand, Como Park provides a cozier and more toddler-friendly space, stretching across a compact 14.5 acres area, that can be covered in roughly 2 hours. 

Offering animal experiences and learning classes, it caters more towards younger children, also aligning with families looking for a relaxed, educational day amidst wildlife. 

Its wheelchair-friendly walkways additionally make it more accessible for families requiring disability access. 

In conclusion, while Minnesota Zoo is better suited for energetic families seeking a full day of adventure, Como Park is ideal for families with smaller children or those seeking a shorter, more manageable excursion.
