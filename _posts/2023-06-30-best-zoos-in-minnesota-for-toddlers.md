Located in the heart of St. 

Paul, Minnesota, Como Park Zoo and Conservatory lands at the top of the list for toddler-friendly adventures in the state. 

Spanning 14.5 acres and boasting an array of notable animals, including majestic tigers, ambling giraffes, languid sloths, playful penguins, and regal lions, it's no wonder families with young children rave about this zoo. 

The zoo's entry fee is donation-based, offering affordable access to rich wildlife experiences for all. 

On average, it takes about two hours to explore the zoo, which includes various interactive animal experiences designed to entertain and educate the tiniest of visitors about wildlife conservation.

Como Park Zoo has carved a niche for itself as a prominent destination for families, specifically those with toddlers, and it's disability-friendly, too. 

Smooth, wheelchair-friendly walkways crisscross the zoo, ensuring that every visitor, no matter their age or mobility level, can easily navigate the array of animal enclosures and exhibits. 

While food stalls dotting the zoo offer a smorgasbord for unanticipated snack breaks, families are also free to bring their own food and drinks making it even more suitable for the unpredictable appetites of toddlers. 

However, as much as this zoo loves animals, pets are not allowed on-premise for the safety and well-being of the wildlife; exceptions are made only for service animals. 

Although Como Park Zoo does not have its own parking and is not accessible by public transport, the refreshingly pure animal encounters and enhanced accessibility features make the journey worthwhile for families with toddlers.
