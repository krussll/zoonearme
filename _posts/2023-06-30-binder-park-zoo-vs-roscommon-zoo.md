## Accesibility 

Although both Binder Park Zoo and Roscommon Zoo promote accessibility for disabled visitors, the degree to which they are accessible differs considerably. 

Binder Park Zoo showcases  a higher level of facilitation for disabled individuals, as it goes a step further by offering the option of renting equipment to assist with mobility. 

This provision, paired with its likely well-paved paths, enables visitors who might have difficulty walking or are in wheelchairs, a more comfortable and enjoyable visit. 

On the contrary, Roscommon Zoo, though also touting disability access, presents some challenges in this regard. 

The pathways throughout the zoo are composed of grass and gravel, which can potentially make navigation difficult for individuals in wheelchairs or those with mobility issues.
