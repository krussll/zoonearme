Como Park, situated in St.Paul, sprawls across 14.5 acres. 

On the other hand, Lake Superior Zoo, established in the city of Duluth, is relatively larger, spanning 19 acres. 

Regardless of the difference in acreage, it takes an average of 2 hours to navigate through each zoo's attractions. 

This indicates that both places have optimized their layouts to ensure visitors get the most out of their experiences, regardless of the size.

## Price 

When it comes to ticket prices, the two zoos present starkly different propositions. 

Como Park Zoo adopts a unique pricing model where admission is effectively a voluntary donation. 

As such, the suggested ticket prices are $4 for adults, $2 for children, and $4 for concessions. 

Importantly, these price suggestions are just that - donations are voluntary and visitors are free to give as much or as little as they wish. 

From this standpoint, a family of four could theoretically visit Como Park Zoo for as little as $12, or for free if they choose not to donate. 

Plus, children under two years old are granted free entry. 

Alternatively, Lake Superior Zoo operates a more traditional ticketing structure. 

Adult tickets are set at $16, with child tickets priced at $10 each. 

Concessions are also $16, and an average family of four would spend $52 in total on entry. 

Like Como Park Zoo, children under two years old can enter for free. 

In comparison, therefore, Lake Superior Zoo is decidedly the more expensive of the two options.

>> The cost of an average family of 4 at Como Park is $12 (voluntary donation) compared to 52 at Lake Superior Zoo.

Lake Superior Zoo, on the other hand, houses tigers and bears, in addition to a number of species not typically available at Como Park, like Kangaroos, barnyard animals, prairie dogs, and lemurs. 

Even though it houses over 200 animals, the Lake Superior Zoo also maintains a policy preventing visitors from handling the animals. 

These two zoos provide a distinct yet overlapping animal viewing experience, each housing a unique set of creatures within their facilities, contributing to their appeal and the enriched experience they offer to visitors.
