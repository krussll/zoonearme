## At A Glance

These are the best zoos in Michigan for Disability Access:

It's always a thrilling adventure to step through those arched gates and be immediately drawn into the astonishing world of animals and nature at a zoo. 

But what if those very gates seemed more like barriers because you are someone with a disability? At an ideal zoo, every animal habitat would be easily accessible to everyone, disabled or not. 

However, it is essential to acknowledge that this is not the case for all zoos in Michigan.

Unfortunately, after extensive research and evaluation, it appears there are currently no zoos in Michigan meeting the standards necessary to be considered fully suitable for those with disabilities. 

While some zoos have been making noticeable strides in improving their facilities, to ensure they become more disability-friendly, they still have a long way to go.

Several aspects need to be looked at when discussing easy access for people with disabilities. 

One crucial factor is wheelchair accessibility. 

For instance, paths should be uniform and smooth, without challenging foothold, allowing for easy traversing. 

Also, viewing areas should be designed in a way where there are minimal obstructions for visitors in wheelchairs to get a full view of the exhibits.

In many Michigan zoos, facilities like accessible washrooms, ramps, and well-placed resting areas are not provided. 

These key considerations can drastically impact someone's visit, making their experience much less enjoyable and comfortable. 

Additionally, braille and tactile features, auditory tools, and low sensory zones are among other necessary amenities for people with visual, auditory, or sensory disabilities which are still missing in these recreational spaces.

Moreover, the lack of staff trained in assisting visitors with disabilities is another serious concern. 

Trained personnel can play a game-changing role, ensuring every visitor, regardless of disability, feels welcome, secure, and well-guided throughout their journey in the zoo. 



So, what does this all mean? It means that while you can certainly visit and enjoy most parts of the zoos in Michigan, it may be challenging if you or someone in your group has a disability. 

A visit may necessitate extra preparation and additional assistance. 



That being said, it doesn't mean the situation is stagnant. 

Zoos across the state are working hard to make their premises more disability-friendly and improve their overall accessibility standards. 

But until these improvements are seen universally across all Michigan zoos, the claim can't be made that they are suitably accessible for all guests, regardless of disabilities. 

Therefore, we must continue to push for more inclusivity and better accommodation because everyone deserves equal opportunities to experience and engage with the amazing world of wildlife.
