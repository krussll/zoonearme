## At A Glance 

In the heartland of America, two distinct zoos provide immersive experiences to families and wildlife enthusiasts alike. 

The Kansas City Zoo is a sprawling 202 acre site boasting a menagerie of over 1,700 animals, of which tigers, giraffes, elephants, lions, and the likes are more notable. 

The zoo, which takes an average of 2-3 hours to explore fully, has an emphasis on family fun and providing ample disability access. 

While pets are prohibited, service animals are welcomed, and cost of entry teeters between $20-$22 per person. 

Nestled in the same state is the Endangered Wolf Center in Eureka, the star of which are the resident wolves that this expansive 2000-acre facility is dedicated to conserving. 

Though lacks food stalls, the center encourages visitors to bring their own sustenance. 

The tours annually last around 90 minutes and ticket prices range from $15-$18, making a family outing noticeably cheaper at $66 for a family of four. 

Both parks are inaccessible by public transport but offer free parking, inviting families to carve out a day amidst the wonder of the animal kingdom.

## Size 

Covering an impressive 202 acres, the Kansas City Zoo in Missouri offers a wealth of fascinating exhibits that families can explore in a 2-3 hour visit. 

On the other hand, the Endangered Wolf Center, also located in Missouri, covers an extensive 2000 acres, almost ten times the size of the Kansas City Zoo. 

Although larger, the average tour at the Endangered Wolf Center typically lasts only around 90 minutes, possibly due to the focus on specific species and the conservation efforts. 

Therefore, while visiting, one has to account for not only the sheer physical size of these zoos, but also the amount of time required to thoroughly explore all the attractions they encompass.

## Accesibility 

When comparing accessibility for those in wheelchairs or who have difficulty walking, both Kansas City Zoo and Endangered Wolf Center offer options, but there are distinct differences. 

The Kansas City Zoo, widely known as a large family-friendly zoo, offers a more disability-friendly environment with wheelchair accessible walkways, ensuring that guests can comfortably maneuver through various exhibits and attractions. 

This ease of access is vital in the wide expanse of the zoo, spanning 202 acres. 

On the other hand, Endangered Wolf Center, the large wolf rescue and conservation center based in Eureka, does present some potential challenges for wheelchair users or those who have difficulty walking. 

While the center does accommodate disabled visitors, some trails may be unsuitable for wheelchairs, suggesting that there may be uneven or possibly steep paths that could be challenging, especially considering the zoo spans a sizable 2000 acres. 

Therefore, for the utmost accessibility, Kansas City Zoo may be the more inclusive option.

## Pefect For 

The Kansas City Zoo and the Endangered Wolf Center both provide remarkable experiences for animal lovers, but they differ in terms of the type of trip they are best suited to. 

Both are well suited for families with older children, with a wide array of animals offered by Kansas City Zoo including tigers, giraffes, capybaras, elephants, sloths, penguins, and lions. 

This makes for an engaging experience for families, including those with disabled members as it has walkways suitable for wheelchairs.

The Kansas City Zoo distinguishes itself with a diverse array of animal species, making it a great option for those wanting to see a variety of animals like tigers, giraffes, penguins, and lions, amongst others.
