## At A Glance

These are the best zoos in Missouri for Dogs:

Missouri is a wonderful place of adventure with a plethora of attractions suitable for the whole family, and that includes our furry four-legged companions. 

From rich, rugged forests to idyllic serene parks, the 'Show-Me' State has so much to offer for outdoor enthusiasts, but when it comes to taking our canine friends on an outing to one among the best zoos in the state - we have to pause.

You might be wondering, 'Can I explore the array of exotic wildlife housed in zoos of Missouri alongside my pawed pal?' Unfortunately, the answer is not as accommodating as we'd like. 

While many zoos have begun to adopt a more pet-friendly approach, it's essential to note that rules and regulations defer depending on a variety of factors for the safety and well-being of both visitors and the animals in care.

To date, there is no zoo available within the state of Missouri that allows dogs or any other pets to accompany their owners. 

This restriction is not casual, but for some crucial reasons that are necessary for welfare and harmony within these beautiful wildlife reserves.

One of the primary reasons for this policy is the safety of the animals in the zoos. 

As much as we strive to bring the natural life of these animals into the urban sphere, zoos are an artificial home for these foreign fauna. 

When confronted with an unexpected intruder, such as dogs, these animals may become agitated, stressed or even aggressive, leading to undesirable situations. 

Also, diseases and parasites that are harmless to dogs may be deadly to the species in the zoo.

On the other side of the coin, dogs may also be at risk. 

Sounds, sights, and even smells of certain animals could trigger defensive reactions, causing unnecessary stress and even potential physical harm to our pets. 

The exotic animal residents of zoos come from diverse corners of the world, carrying with them their unique microbes. 

These microbes harmless to their native hosts, could pose significant risks to our pets.

The intention behind these policies beyond food and drink restrictions, noise abatements, and even restrictions on certain types of clothing, is to provide a tranquil space for zoo inhabitants and a safe, educational experience for visitors. 



So, although as dog-lovers, we may lament the lack of zoos suitable for our canine friends in Missouri, we can appreciate the reasons behind the rules. 

The state is famous for its sprawling parks and walking trails that are the perfect outing spots for dogs. 

Let the zoos be a sanctuary for the wildlife, while we find other majestic corners of Missouri to explore with our pups.
