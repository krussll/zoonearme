## At A Glance 

Wondering where to find those adorable, long-necked creatures – giraffes – in Montana's zoos? Well, the thing is, you can't. 

Unlike some of its neighboring states, believe it or not, Montana does not currently house any giraffes in its zoos. 

Indeed, the state, with its varied landscapes and vibrant wildlife settings, is home to a multitude of animals. 

However, for those with a soft spot for the gentle, towering creatures that are giraffes, there's a notable absence in the roster of animal inhabitants in Montana's zoo displays.

The most likely reason for this is the climate of Montana. 

The state experiences a diverse range of weather conditions throughout the year, from intensely hot summers to cold, snowy winters - a far cry from the more stable, warm conditions that giraffes are used to in their natural African habitats. 

The drastic weather changes might pose significant challenges in creating a suitable and sustainable habitat for giraffes within the zoos. 

Subsequently, they may experience stress or other health issues which could affect their lifespan. 

As such, opting not to host these animals is likely a choice made in the best interest of the giraffes' welfare.

The Center is made easily navigable for wheelchair users, promising an inclusive family experience.
