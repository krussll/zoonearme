The Detroit Zoo is home to an impressive 245 species of animals, making it a bustling and diverse hub of wildlife. 

On the other hand, John Ball Zoo, while slightly more modest with its 200 species, still offers a wonderful array of creatures to see and learn about, including true zoo favorites like tigers, bears, penguins, and lions. 

However, visitors to the John Ball Zoo will miss out on seeing certain species such as giraffes, kangaroos, and zebras, which are part of the animal kingdom display at the Detroit Zoo. 

Thus, if the sheer number and variety of animals is your main criteria in choosing a zoo for a visit, Detroit Zoo with its larger range seems to be the more attractive choice.

## Accesibility 

Both Detroit Zoo and John Ball Zoo have made commendable efforts to make their facilities accessible to individuals with difficulty in walking or those bound to wheelchairs. 

At the Detroit Zoo, the extensive grounds, covering 125 acres, are made accessible through a combination of paved, gravel and woodchipped walkways. 

However, accessibility may prove challenging in hilly and sloped areas which require a certain caution. 

Similarly, John Ball Zoo, though smaller at 31 acres, is also accessible to differently-abled visitors. 

A favorable edge at the John Ball Zoo is the availability of rentable equipment that makes moving around easier and convenient, creating a more comfortable experience for those with mobility issues. 

It is equally wonderful to see that both zoos not only provide physical access but also uphold inclusivity by permitting the legally protected service animals to accompany their owners.

## Pefect For

The John Ball Zoo, despite being smaller, takes around the same time to explore as the far larger Detroit Zoo making it a more compact adventure for families and particularly friendly for families with toddlers as well. 

Both zoos provide excellent disability access, though it's worth noting that Detroit Zoo has some hilly areas and different types of walkways surfaces, thus it might require a bit more mobility. 

Conversely, John Ball Zoo offers rental equipment to support those with mobility limitations. 

While both zoos prohibit pet dogs (but do allow service animals), and do not allow handling of the animals, they both allow you to bring your own food and drinks, making it easier for families to plan their day. 

In a nutshell, depending upon the specifics of your family and your personal preference, either could serve as a delightful choice for a family day out.
