## At A Glance 

If you are a Capybara enthusiast planning a visit to Montana with high hopes of catching a glimpse of these oversized, charismatic rodents, we'd hate to let you down— but the harsh reality is that you're unlikely to see any in the zoos here. 

As shocking as this might be considering the Capybara's soaring popularity in zoos and wildlife parks across the globe, not a single zoo in Montana houses these fascinating creatures. 

Regardless of the respective zoo's size or scope of species, the Capybara - a native species to South America - is simply off the menu.

The primary reason for this peculiar absence is none other than Montana's harsh climate, which is considerably different from the Capybara's native tropical environments. 

The biggest rodent in the world, Capybaras thrive in regions near bodies of water and need warm-weather conditions to survive, something Montana’s freezing winters cannot provide. 

Our most beloved Montana zoos emphasize creating environments that are conducive to and mimic the natural habitats of their animals, and as much as they'd love to accommodate these semi-aquatic creatures, Montana's cold and dry climate poses a significant hurdle. 

With severe cold spells and snowy winters, it is simply unfit for the heat-loving Capybaras, hence their unavoidable absence.
