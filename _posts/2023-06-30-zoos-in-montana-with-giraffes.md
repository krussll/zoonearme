### ZooMontana

ZooMontana, based in Billings, is an enchanting family-friendly location that lets visitors experience the thrilling spectacle of African wildlife, specifically giraffes, without leaving the state of Montana. 

Not only will you get to see the long-legged, long-necked wonders ambling and grazing in a simulation of their natural habitat, but the zoo also offers an informative and educational experience underlining the importance of conservation. 

This medium-sized zoo, spread over a sprawling 70 acres, captivates with its enormous collection of over 100 animals that include other beguiling species like tigers, sloths, and bears. 

It’s easy to spend 2-3 hours meandering the grounds, taking in not only the giraffes, but the variety of animals on display.

Despite its size and popularity, ZooMontana maintains an affordable visitor experience. 

A standard adult ticket costs just $12 while a child ticket is priced at $9 making it a highly economical choice for families; a family of four, for example, can enjoy a day out at the zoo for $44. 

Plus, children under the age of 2 get free entry! Accessibility isn’t an issue either, as ample free parking is available for visitors, offering a smooth and hassle-free visit. 

And should you get peckish while exploring, the zoo has food stalls catering to different tastes, but you’re also welcome to bring in your own food and drinks. 

However, it’s important to note that you cannot hold any of the animals. 

Nonetheless, the opportunity to observe these great beasts up close is a delightful experience in itself. 

So, for the love of giraffes and nature, make sure to plan your next family trip to ZooMontana!

### Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center

Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center comfortably nestled in West Yellowstone, Montana, is a must-visit for animal enthusiasts, particularly for those with a penchant for giraffes. 

Although the zoo is famous more for being a haven for rescued wolves and grizzly bears, its winning charm lies in its sheer size and variety of wildlife, spread across an expansive 14-acre area. 

You'll need ample time—approximately 1.5 hours—to cover the entire ground and explore all its attractions fully. 

One unique aspect about this zoo is that, while it doesn't involve the typical thrill of holding animals, the complete experience is curated to give you an upfront view of these majestic creatures, making it an engaging visit nonetheless.

Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center's conservation focus is also applaudable, offering much more than just entertainment. 

The zoo has taken commendable strides in the rescue and conservation of wolves and grizzly bears, boosting its reputation in the realm of wildlife preservation. 

Despite not having internal food stalls, they offer visitors the flexibility to bring their own food and beverages, catering to the comfort and convenience of all guests. 

Surprisingly affordable, a family of four can enjoy the zoo's many splendors at a total cost of $56, with free entry for children under four years old. 

Also, the provision of free parking and easy accessibility, even though the zoo is not served by public transport, just adds to the overall visitor-friendly experience. 

All these features make Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center one of the best zoos in Montana to view not just wolves, grizzly bears, otters, and birds of prey, but also the towering beauty of giraffes.
