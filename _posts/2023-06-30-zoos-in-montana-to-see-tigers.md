While it might not feature tigers, it offers an unforgettable experience observing wolves, bears, otters, and birds of prey up-close in natural habitats. 

It's a unique center that not only serves as a zoo spanning a sizeable 14 acres, but also a haven for wolf and grizzly bear rescue and conservation.
