Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center, set in the heart of the scenic West Yellowstone in Montana, USA, is a large, haven for wildlife enthusiasts. 

Nestled amidst the expansive 14 acres of land, this sanctuary focuses primarily on the rescue and conservation of wolves and grizzly bears, although it also houses otters and birds of prey. 

As a testament to its engagement in conservation efforts, the zoo does not showcase animals captured from the wild; instead, it provides a secure and enriching habitat for animals who cannot survive independently.

Not just a zoo, the Center serves as a fantastic, educative platform aiming to strengthen the bond between humans and nature. 

Designed keeping inclusivity in mind, the zoo's pathways are wheelchair-accessible, making it a perfect outing spot for families, including those with older children and differently-abled members. 

Visitors should plan at least 1.5 hours to tour the zoo, with adult tickets priced at $16.5, child tickets at $11.5, and consessions tickets at $15.5. 

As a bonus, children under the age of 4 are granted free entry, and families of 4 can enjoy a day out at a comfortable total cost of $56. 

However, visitors need to plan their transportation, as public transit unfortunately doesn’t reach the Center. 

The provision of free parking does make up for this, and although there are no food stalls, families can bring their own picnic to enjoy amidst the beauty of nature.
