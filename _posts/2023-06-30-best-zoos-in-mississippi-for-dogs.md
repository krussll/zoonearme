## At A Glance

Though it's an engaging thought, it's important to clarify that there currently are no zoos across the state of Mississippi that cater specifically to dogs. 

Traditional zoos are primarily configured to showcase a variety of wildlife from around the globe to human audience, not pets. 

There are several dog parks and pet-friendly spaces across the state where our canine companions can play, socialize and be entertained, but zoos present several dangers and stressors for dogs including large crowds, loud noises, and exposure to unfamiliar and potentially frightening animals. 

Also, many zoos have specific policies that prohibit dogs for the safety and comfort of their animal inhabitants. 

Nevertheless, Mississippi still offers a range of fun, dog-friendly activities beyond the zoo!
